    <p>
        Gabriel loves reading manga, wattpad, and etc. That's why he chooses to create this website, he was inspired by the writers
        of the stories and amazed of how they imagine/think. Of all the website that he wants to create why did he choose this one? It was
        also one of Gab's dream to also become a writer even though he was still a beginner of creating a story he still never gave up
        of achieving one of his dreams.Gabriel always knew that writing wasn't going to be easy, but that never discouraged him. He sees every challenge 
        as part of the journey to improving his skills. Starting the website is more than just sharing storiesâ€”it's about building a community 
        where people like him, who are passionate about writing and storytelling, can come together. He hopes to create a space where beginners, 
        like himself, can grow and share ideas without fear of judgment. For him, this isn't just a project, it's a dream that's slowly becoming real, 
        one step at a time. Gabriel believes that no matter how tough things get, if he keeps going, he'll eventually reach his goal.
