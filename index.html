    <h3> Gabriel Hangad, Creator of I-STORIES</h3>
    <p>
        Gabriel Hangad is the person behind the I-STORIES website, <br>
        a website that's all about imagination, and based on Gab's<br>
        real experience. He wanted to create a place where the reader/s <br>
        (filipinos) could enjoy and relieve there stress by reading <br>
        I-STORIES and not hard to read for them (tagalog, cebuano, english). <br>
        I means "Me" and STORIES means "Imaginary" or real, <br>
        if you combine the two it means "My Imagination" this also <br>
        inspired by GENDESU.
